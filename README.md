## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job outlining the scope and direction for your PWP. Since you have an existing consulting business, you'll have a good understanding of your existing client base and the kind of clients you'll be marketing to. Use this information to inform and guide your design phase/content strategy in Milestone 2a as you look to increase your leads and close ratio. I'm looking forward to seeing what you create here. Do you have any existing branding that you'll be incorporating into this project as well?

Given your outlined goals, this project has plenty of potential for growth and expansion. You may find that your business needs may require more than a simple one-page website down the line/after graduation. In this case, you can treat this project (PWP) as an exploratory testing ground for your ideas and development that you can expand upon later.

Technically your project looks good. Your project and directory structure are set up correctly and your code looks good overall.

Nice work - I look forward to seeing your design ideas going forward. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin Milestone 2a.
